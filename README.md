# pycls

**pycls** is an image classification codebase, written in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). It was originally developed for the [On Network Design Spaces for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13214) project. **pycls** has since matured and been adopted by a number of [projects](#projects) at Facebook AI Research.

## Introduction

The goal of **pycls** is to provide a simple and flexible codebase for image classification. It is designed to support rapid implementation and evaluation of research ideas. **pycls** also provides a large collection of baseline results ([Model Zoo](MODEL_ZOO.md)).

The codebase supports efficient single-machine multi-gpu training, powered by the PyTorch distributed package, and provides implementations of standard models including [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), [ResNeXt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431), [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946), and [RegNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13678).

## Using pycls

Please see [`INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md) for brief installation instructions. After installation, please see [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for basic instructions and example commands on training and evaluation with **pycls**.

## Model Zoo

We provide a large set of baseline results and pretrained models available for download in the **pycls** [Model Zoo](MODEL_ZOO.md); including the simple, fast, and effective [RegNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13678) models that we hope can serve as solid baselines across a wide range of flop regimes.

## Projects

A number of projects at FAIR have been built on top of **pycls**:

- [On Network Design Spaces for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13214)
- [Exploring Randomly Wired Neural Networks for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01569)
- [Designing Network Design Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13678)
- [Are Labels Necessary for Neural Architecture Search?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12056)
- [PySlowFast Video Understanding Codebase](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast)
